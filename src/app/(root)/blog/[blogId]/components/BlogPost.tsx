              We're thrilled to announce the launch of the Sintra AI app for
              iOS, available from November 2024! The app marks a significant
              step in our commitment to empowering small and medium-sized
              businesses with accessible, on-demand AI employees. Now, you can
              manage and interact with your virtual team directly from your
              iPhone or iPad, transforming business operations on the go.
            </p>

              Today's business environment is competitive, and time is of the
              essence. One key advantage is making AI-powered
              information-related decisions early across various Sintra AI agent
              roles. Launching the mobile app eliminates many of the challenges
              Sintra users face while away from their computers.

              mobile app addresses the challenges of managing AI agents

              Lack of Accessibility on the Go
            </h3>

            <p>
              Suppose you are frequently mobile and lack consistent access to a
              computer. In that case, the Sintra mobile app provides access to
              your Sintra agents and workspace anytime, anywhere, directly from
              your iPhone or iPad. A case in point is you can ask the customer
              support agent Cassie to generate reports on last month's customer
              support metrics or ask your E-commerce specialist to update
              product listings while commuting.
